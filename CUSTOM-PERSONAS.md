## Troubleshooting

**Persona not appearing?**
- Refresh the page - data loads from localStorage on mount

**Chat using wrong persona?**
- Click "Manage Personas" and select the correct one
- Make sure you clicked "Chat" on the right persona card

**Lost a persona?**
- Check if browser data/localStorage was cleared
- Personas are stored locally - can't be recovered if cleared

**Persona not responding correctly?**
- Edit the persona and refine the system prompt
- Be more specific about desired behavior
- Add response length guidance

**Chat not working / Database error?**
If you see errors like "null value in column 'persona_type' violates not-null constraint":

1. **This is a database schema issue** that needs to be fixed in Supabase
2. **Follow the fix guide**: See `DATABASE-FIX.md` for detailed instructions
3. **Quick fix**: Go to your Supabase SQL Editor and run:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE conversations ALTER COLUMN persona_type DROP NOT NULL;
   ALTER TABLE conversations ALTER COLUMN persona_type SET DEFAULT 'custom';
   ```
4. After running the SQL, refresh your app and try again

**Error Details:**
- The database was designed for predefined personas
- Custom personas use localStorage instead
- The `persona_type` column needs to be nullable to support this architecture
- Running the SQL migration fixes this permanently

## Future Enhancements (Planned)

- üîÑ Export/import personas
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud sync (optional)
- üìä Conversation analytics
- üé® More customization options (colors, avatars)
- üîÄ Persona templates/marketplace

## API Integration

The custom personas integrate seamlessly with the chat API:

```typescript
// Request includes persona information
{
  sessionId: string,
  personaId: string,      // UUID of the persona
  personaPrompt: string,  // The custom system prompt
  message: string
}
```

## Security Notes

- All data stored locally - no server sync by default
- Prompts are sent to AI API for each message
- No personal data is extracted or stored separately
- Clear browser data to wipe all personas
