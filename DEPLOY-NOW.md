# üö® DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS - READ CAREFULLY

## ‚ö†Ô∏è  CRITICAL: Follow these steps IN ORDER

## Issues Found & Fixed:

### ‚úÖ Issue #1: Privacy Violation - All Users Seeing Everyone's Personas
**Status:** FIXED (code committed, ready to deploy)
**Impact:** HIGH - Every user could see all other users' personas

### ‚è≥ Issue #2: Chat Not Working
**Status:** TO BE INVESTIGATED after Issue #1 deployed

## üìã DEPLOYMENT STEPS (DO NOT SKIP!)

### Step 1: Run SQL Migration in Supabase (MUST DO FIRST!)

**Why:** The code expects a `session_identifier` column that doesn't exist yet.
**If you skip this:** The site will crash with database errors!

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your Esperit/Future-You project
3. Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
4. Click "New query"
5. Open the file `fix-personas-privacy.sql` in this directory
6. Copy ALL the SQL code
7. Paste it into the Supabase SQL Editor
8. Click "Run" (or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)
9. Verify you see: `Session identifier column added successfully`

**What this does:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE personas ADD COLUMN session_identifier TEXT;
CREATE INDEX idx_personas_session_identifier ON personas(session_identifier);
```

### Step 2: Push Code to GitHub

Only AFTER completing Step 1:

```bash
cd /Users/gaurav/esperit
git push origin main
```

This will auto-trigger Vercel deployment.

### Step 3: Wait for Vercel Deployment (~2 minutes)

Monitor at: https://vercel.com/dashboard

### Step 4: Verify the Fix Works

1. **Open incognito window #1**
   - Go to https://future-you-six.vercel.app
   - Click "Continue as Guest"
   - Create a persona named "Test Person 1"
   - You should see ONLY "Test Person 1"

2. **Open incognito window #2** (different browser or device)
   - Go to https://future-you-six.vercel.app
   - Click "Continue as Guest"
   - Create a persona named "Test Person 2"
   - You should see ONLY "Test Person 2"
   - You should NOT see "Test Person 1"

3. **Go back to incognito #1**
   - Refresh the page
   - You should still see ONLY "Test Person 1"
   - You should NOT see "Test Person 2"

**If this works:** ‚úÖ Privacy fix is successful!

### Step 5: Test Chat Functionality

After verifying Issue #1 is fixed:

1. Create a persona
2. Click "Chat" button
3. Try sending a message
4. Report what happens:
   - ‚úÖ Message sends and you get AI response
   - ‚ùå Error message appears
   - ‚ùå Nothing happens
   - ‚ùå Other issue: _____________

## üîç What Was Fixed

**Before:**
- `GET /api/personas` returned ALL personas from ALL users
- Every user could see everyone's personas
- Major privacy violation

**After:**
- `GET /api/personas?sessionId=guest_123` returns ONLY that user's personas
- Each user session is isolated
- Privacy restored

**Technical Changes:**
- Added `session_identifier` column to personas table
- Modified `getAllPersonas(sessionIdentifier?)` to filter by session
- Frontend sends `userId` from localStorage as `sessionId`
- API filters personas by matching `session_identifier`

---

## üìä Files Changed

- ‚úÖ `src/lib/api/supabase.ts` - Added session filtering to getAllPersonas
- ‚úÖ `src/app/api/personas/route.ts` - Pass sessionId to database queries
- ‚úÖ `src/lib/utils/personas.ts` - Send sessionId from frontend
- ‚úÖ `fix-personas-privacy.sql` - Database migration (RUN THIS FIRST!)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è  TROUBLESHOOTING

**If deployment fails:**

Check Vercel logs for this error:
```
column "session_identifier" does not exist
```

**Solution:** You forgot Step 1! Run the SQL migration in Supabase.

**If personas don't filter:**

Check browser console for errors. Should see:
```
üîç Fetching personas for session: guest_1729846123
‚úÖ Loaded 1 personas from API
```
