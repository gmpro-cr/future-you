## 📝 Tips for Writing Great Descriptions

### ✅ DO:
- **Be specific**: Include your profession, achievements, and lifestyle
- **Use first person**: "I'm a...", "I've become...", "I run..."
- **Add personality**: Are you bold? Calm? Creative? Driven?
- **Be aspirational**: Describe your dream life 10 years from now
- **Include details**: Where do you live? What's your daily life like?
- **Show impact**: How have you helped others? What legacy are you building?

### ❌ DON'T:
- Be vague: "I'm successful" ← Too generic!
- Use second/third person: "You will be..." or "He/She is..."
- Be too short: "I'm rich" ← Needs more context
- Exceed 300 characters: Keep it focused and concise

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. User clicks "Create Your Own" card
2. `PersonaGrid` shows `CustomPersonaDialog`
3. User submits description
4. `usePersona` hook saves to localStorage
5. Description passed through:
   - `ChatPage` → `ChatInterface` → `useChat` → API `/api/chat`
6. Backend `getPersonaPrompt()` uses custom description
7. Gemini generates responses as the custom persona

### Storage
- **Persona Type**: Stored in `localStorage` as `'custom'`
- **Description**: Stored in `custom_persona_description` key
- **Persistence**: Survives page refreshes and browser restarts

### API Integration
```javascript
// Request to /api/chat
{
  sessionId: "abc123",
  conversationId: null,
  personaType: "custom",
  message: "What advice do you have?",
  customPersonaDescription: "I'm a Bollywood director..." // ← Custom!
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test the Feature

1. **Navigate to personas**: http://localhost:3000/persona
2. **Find the purple card**: "Create Your Own" with ✨
3. **Click it**: Dialog should open
4. **Try invalid input**:
   - Type "Hello" (only 5 chars) → Should show error "Need 15 more"
   - Type 301 characters → Should be blocked
5. **Submit valid description**:
   ```
   I'm a space scientist at ISRO who led India's first Mars colony mission
   ```
6. **Verify**:
   - Card should show your description
   - Card should have purple border when selected
   - Click "Continue to Chat"
7. **Send a message**: "What was your biggest challenge?"
8. **Verify AI response**: Should respond as YOUR custom persona!

### Expected AI Response
For the space scientist example above, the AI might respond:
> "The biggest challenge wasn't the technical complexity—it was convincing the government and public that investing in a Mars colony was worth it when we had so many problems on Earth. I remember the late nights presenting to parliament, showing how this would inspire an entire generation of Indian scientists and engineers..."

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Create Your Own" card not showing
- **Check**: `src/lib/utils/constants.ts` has `custom` persona
- **Verify**: Dev server restarted after adding

### Dialog doesn't open
- **Check**: Browser console for errors
- **Verify**: `CustomPersonaDialog.tsx` file exists

### Description not saving
- **Check**: Browser localStorage (Dev Tools → Application → Local Storage)
- **Look for**: `custom_persona_description` key

### AI not using custom description
- **Check**: Network tab → `/api/chat` request includes `customPersonaDescription`
- **Verify**: Backend `getPersonaPrompt()` handles custom type
